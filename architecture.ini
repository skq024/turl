## 2. Component Details

### 2.1 Data Mining Pipeline

**Purpose**: Extract, transform, and load census data from the US Census QuickFacts website.

**Key Components**:
- `CensusQuickFactsSpider`: Scrapy-based spider for navigating and extracting data
- `CensusDataProcessor`: Processes raw scraped data into structured formats for database loading

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implemented in Python using Scrapy and BeautifulSoup
- Crawls hierarchically through the Census QuickFacts website
- Extracts both geodata (boundaries) and demographic information
- Cleans and normalizes data before loading into PostgreSQL

**Design Decisions**:
- Separation of concerns between scraping (extraction) and processing (transformation)
- Scalable and extendable architecture that can be expanded to other data sources
- Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms for robustness

### 2.2 Database Layer

**Purpose**: Store geospatial and demographic data with efficient querying capabilities.

**Key Components**:
- PostgreSQL: Relational database management system
- PostGIS: Spatial database extension for PostgreSQL

**Schema Design**:
- `locations` table: Stores geographical entities with spatial geometry
- `demographics` table: Stores time-series demographic data
- `common_indicators` materialized view: Pre-computes commonly accessed indicators

**Spatial Functions**:
- `find_nearby_locations`: Finds locations within a specified distance
- `find_locations_in_polygon`: Finds locations within a drawn polygon
- `find_containing_regions`: Finds regions containing a specific point

**Design Decisions**:
- Use of spatial indices (GIST) for efficient geospatial queries
- Implementation of materialized views for performance optimization
- Normalized schema design for flexibility and data integrity

### 2.3 Cache Layer

**Purpose**: Provide low-latency access to frequently requested data.

**Key Components**:
- Redis: In-memory data structure store used as cache
- GeoCache Class: Custom implementation for geospatial caching

**Caching Strategy**:
- Query result caching: Store API query results with appropriate TTL
- Geospatial data caching: Store location boundaries and demographic data
- Parameterized cache keys: Generate consistent keys based on query parameters

**Design Decisions**:
- Separate cache for different types of data (boundaries, demographics, query results)
- Configurable TTL for different data types
- Cache invalidation strategy for data updates

### 2.4 Backend API

**Purpose**: Provide RESTful endpoints for geospatial queries and data access.

**Key Components**:
- FastAPI: High-performance Python web framework
- Pydantic models: Data validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and ORM

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/locations`: Get locations with optional filtering
- `/api/nearby`: Find locations near a specified point
- `/api/within`: Find locations within a polygon
- `/api/containing`: Find regions containing a point
- `/api/demographics/{location_id}`: Get demographic data for a location
- `/api/timeseries/{location_id}/{category}`: Get time series data for demographics
- `/api/compare/{category}`: Compare demographic data across locations

**Design Decisions**:
- RESTful API design for intuitive usage and broad compatibility
- Asynchronous request handling for high concurrency
- Caching integration for performance optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 2.5 Frontend Application

**Purpose**: Provide interactive visualization and user interface for geospatial data exploration.

**Key Components**:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Core web technologies
- Mapbox GL JS: Interactive mapping library
- Chart.js: Data visualization library

**Features**:
- Interactive map with location visualization
- Choropleth maps for demographic data visualization
- Geospatial query tools (nearby search, polygon drawing)
- Time-series visualization of demographic changes
- Responsive design for various device formats

**Design Decisions**:
- Client-side rendering for interactive experience
- Modular JavaScript architecture for maintainability
- Progressive data loading to minimize initial page load time
- Responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility

### 2.6 Containerization and Deployment

**Purpose**: Package and deploy all components in a consistent, reproducible environment.

**Key Components**:
- Docker: Container platform
- Docker Compose: Multi-container orchestration
- Nginx: Web server for frontend hosting and potential reverse proxy

**Container Architecture**:
- `postgres`: PostgreSQL with PostGIS database
- `redis`: Redis cache server
- `backend`: FastAPI backend service
- `scraper`: Data scraper container (runs as a job)
- `frontend`: Nginx serving the web application

**Design Decisions**:
- Separation of services into individual containers
- Environment variable configuration for flexibility
- Volume mounting for persistent data storage
- Health checks for robust orchestration

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1 Initial Data Loading

1. The scraper container crawls the US Census QuickFacts website
2. Raw data is processed and transformed into structured formats
3. Processed data is loaded into PostgreSQL database
4. Indices and materialized views are created/refreshed

### 3.2 User Interaction Flow

1. User accesses the web application through a browser
2. Frontend loads and initializes the map interface
3. Initial data is loaded from the backend API
4. User interacts with the map (clicks, draws, filters)
5. Frontend makes API requests based on user actions
6. Backend processes requests, checking cache first
7. If data is not in cache, PostgreSQL queries are executed
8. Results are cached for future requests
9. Data is returned to frontend for visualization

### 3.3 Geospatial Query Flow

1. User initiates a geospatial query (e.g., finding nearby locations)
2. Frontend sends query parameters to backend API
3. Backend checks if query result exists in cache
4. If not in cache, specialized PostGIS functions are executed
5. Results are processed, cached, and returned to frontend
6. Frontend visualizes results on the map and in data panels
